# Robo Rover

This project is modeled after the [NASA sample return challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html) and it will give you first hand experience with the three essential elements of robotics, which are perception, decision making and actuation.  You will carry out this project in a simulator environment built with the Unity game engine.

## The Simulator
The first step is to download the simulator build that's appropriate for your operating system.
